# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tr# RvNBo – Traveler & Land Owner Booking Platform

RvNBo is a dynamic and user-friendly web application that connects **Travelers** looking for unique spots to stay with **Land Owners** offering private land for rent. Built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI**, this app offers a modern, responsive interface tailored to both user types.
